I've been blogging on and off for a few years now but I never really made it a priority. 

I fully intend to change that. My goal is at least two articles per month.

As a first step, I've let myself inspired by [Ash Furrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjjvnrqDjpM) and [Ole Begemann](http://oleb.net/blog/2015/06/redesign/) and switched my blogging engine from Wordpress to [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com). While at it, I also borrowed the [Clean Blog]() implementation from [Ash](https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog). 

Onwardsâ€¦
