  <h3 id="blur"><a href="https://www.blurmessage.com">Blur</a></h3>
  <p><em>iOS development, iMessage App</em></p>
  <div class="li-img">

    <p><img src="assets/blur.png" class="project-thumb" /></p>

  </div>
  <div class="li-text">
    <p><a href="https://www.blurmessage.com">Blur</a> started out as an exploratory skunk works project to find out what is possible with the new iMessage extensions. I implemented the first version of the app and prototyped the required backend functionalities. After the potential of the idea was evident, the prototype was prepared quickly for the first release in close collaboration with the team in San Francisco and made it into the App Store on the launch day of iOS 10.</p>

  <h3 id="automatic"><a href="http://www.automatic.com">Automatic</a></h3>
  <p><em>iOS development</em></p>
  <div class="li-img">

    <p><img src="assets/Automatic.jpg" class="project-thumb" /></p>

  </div>
  <div class="li-text">
    <p>I have helped Automatic with their brand-new soon-to-be-released iOS App. Quite a complex project written from the ground up, which must be able to handle everything from bluetooth connections to the dongles to UI animations. We used Reactive Cocoa and MVVM to keep the complexity managable</p>

<div class="project-container">

  <h3 id="juke"><a href="http://www.juke.com">JUKE</a></h3>
  <p><em>iOS development</em></p>
  <div class="li-img">

    <p><img src="assets/juke.jpeg" class="project-thumb" /></p>

  </div>
  <div class="li-text">
    <p>Mediamarkt/Saturn had acquired the technology behind the JUKE app from a previous vendor that had gone bankrupt. I helped them to make sense of the big legacy codebase and create the JUKE e-Books app and release it on the App Store. This allowed them start selling books from their catalog of over 1.5 million titles and start making revenue in a very short time.</p>

<div class="project-container">

  <h3 id="blloon"><a href="http://www.edenspiekermann.com/projects/blloon/">Blloon</a></h3>
  <p><em>Technical co-founder</em></p>
  <div class="li-img">

    <p><img src="assets/blloon.jpg" class="project-thumb" /></p>

  </div>
  <div class="li-text">
    <p>At Blloon, we built an e-book subscription platform, where the users received a certain amount of pages every month, which they could spend on any book from the almost 1 million titles in the catalog. I had the pleasure to work with the design experts from <a href="http://www.edenspiekermann.com/projects/blloon/">EdenSpiekermann</a> and learned a lot from them. Unfortunately the business assumptions did not work out and we had to close the service.</p>

  <h3 id="moped"><a href="">Moped</a></h3>
  <p><em>First iOS engineer, mobile product</em></p>
  <div class="li-img">

    <p><img src="assets/moped.jpg" class="project-thumb" /></p>

  </div>
  <div class="li-text">
    <p>Moped was a messaging service which integated with the internet. @-mentioning other users, hashtagging topics, previewing links, showing inline audio and video. It was a poor-man’s Slack back in 2012. Unfortunately, we did not manage to gather enough traction before the money ran out.</p>

  <p><em>Technical co-founder</em></p>
  <div class="li-img">

    <p><img src="assets/pistachio.png" class="project-thumb" /></p>

  </div>
  <div class="li-text">
    <p>Pistachio started out in 2010 a spontaneous social network, where people could broadcast their free-time for the next few hours and get matched with their friends or friends-of-friends around the area for a coffee or a drink.</p>
