### Hello there!

I am jack of all trades. I built my first iPhone app [Translate](http://gettranslate.app/) back in 2008. Initially it was an outlet for procrastination while I was supposed to be finishing my Ph.D. Building apps quickly grew into a real labor of love. Over the years, besides building apps, I helped various startups build, validate and grow their iOS apps.

My last jobby job was being the general manager of [Keepsafe Europe](http://getkeepsafe.com/), where I started the Berlin office and built a kick-ass team to build and grow apps which are used by millions of people every day.

I organize [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com) together with [Sabine](https://twitter.com/sabinegeithner), [Bianca](https://twitter.com/biancawalty), [Julia](https://twitter.com/KallenbergJulia) and [Chrissy](https://twitter.com/post4chrissy).

I live in Berlin with my wife and son. Whenever I have some free time you can find me [flying gliders](http://fccberlin.de/) (real pilots need no engines!) or driving old sports cars.
